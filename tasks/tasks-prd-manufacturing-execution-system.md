## Dependency Mapping

### Dependency Flow
```
1.0 Infrastructure (1.1-1.5 Common → 1.6-1.19 Kent)
    ↓
2.0 Database Models (2.1-2.2 Common → 2.3-2.18 Kent)
    ↓
3.0 Backend Services (3.1-3.2 Common → 3.3-3.23 Kent)
    ↓
4.0 User Interfaces (4.1-4.3 Common → 4.4-4.25 Kent)
    ↓
5.0 Real-time & Analytics (5.1-5.2 Common → 5.3-5.22 Kent)
```

### Critical Path
1. **Week 1**: Complete infrastructure setup (1.0)
2. **Week 2**: Finish database architecture (2.0)
3. **Week 3-4**: Implement core backend services (3.0)
4. **Week 5-6**: Build portal interfaces (4.0)
5. **Week 7**: Add real-time features and analytics (5.0)
6. **Week 8**: Integration testing and optimization

### Integration Points
- After 1.0: Verify all services are running via health checks
- After 2.0: Validate database schema with test data
- After 3.0: Test all API endpoints with Swagger
- After 4.0: Conduct user acceptance testing
- After 5.0: Performance testing and optimization

### Solo Developer (Kent) Optimization Strategy
Since Kent is working alone, the tasks are organized to:
1. Build complete vertical slices (backend → frontend) for each feature
2. Focus on MVP features first, then enhance
3. Leverage the enterprise template for rapid development
4. Use Docker and Makefile for efficient workflow
5. Implement comprehensive testing to catch issues early
