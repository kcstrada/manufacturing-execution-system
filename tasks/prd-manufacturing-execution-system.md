# Product Requirements Document: Manufacturing Execution System

## Introduction/Overview

The Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is a comprehensive production management platform designed to streamline the entire manufacturing workflow from sales orders to product delivery. This system addresses the critical need for real-time visibility into production processes, inventory management, and workforce coordination. It enables executives to monitor manufacturing operations, helps supervisors assign and track tasks efficiently, empowers workers to complete their assignments with clarity, and allows sales teams to manage orders seamlessly.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Create a **production-ready, enterprise-grade full-stack application** called **{PROJECT_NAME}** with modern architecture patterns, comprehensive authentication/authorization, and developer-friendly tooling.

**System Description**: {SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION}

**Key Features:**
- 🏢 Multi-tenant SaaS architecture with data isolation
- 🔐 Enterprise authentication (Keycloak) + fine-grained authorization (OpenFGA)
- 🚀 Dual portal system (Admin + User interfaces)
- 📦 Complete containerized development environment
- 🛠️ Developer workflow automation with Make commands

- **Sales Portal**: Responsive web interface for order management and tracking
- Clean, intuitive design following Material Design principles
- High contrast UI elements for factory floor visibility
- Large touch targets for gloved hands in worker interface

### Visual Requirements
- Real-time status indicators using color coding (Green: On Track, Yellow: Warning, Red: Critical)
- Gantt chart visualization for production scheduling
- Kanban board view for task management
- Interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- Should follow the full-stack template architecture with NestJS backend and Next.js frontend
- Multi-tenant architecture to support potential future expansion
- Real-time updates using WebSockets for production status changes
- Redis caching for frequently accessed inventory data

### Performance
- Dashboard load time should be under 2 seconds
- Task updates should reflect in real-time (< 500ms)
- System should support 100+ concurrent users

### Security
- Implement Keycloak for authentication and SSO
- Use OpenFGA for fine-grained permission management
- Audit trail for all critical operations
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

### Mobile Considerations
- Progressive Web App (PWA) for worker portal to enable offline caching
- Barcode/QR code scanning capability for material tracking
- Push notifications for urgent task assignments

## Success Metrics

   - Reduce material waste by 15% through better tracking

3. **Worker Productivity**
   - Increase tasks completed per worker by 20% within 6 months
   - Reduce idle time between tasks by 30%

4. **System Adoption**
   - Achieve 100% worker adoption within 1 month of deployment
   - Maintain system uptime of 99.5%

5. **Quality Metrics**
   - Reduce quality issues by 20% through better process tracking
   - Decrease rework rate by 15%

## Open Questions

1. **Automation Potential**: While manual task assignment is the current requirement, should the system be designed to accommodate future automation?

2. **Mobile Hardware**: Will workers use company-provided devices or personal devices? This affects security and app distribution strategies.

3. **Backup Procedures**: What should happen if the system goes down? Is there a manual fallback process?

4. **Training Requirements**: What level of technical expertise can we assume for different user groups?

5. **Data Retention**: How long should historical production data be retained in the system?

6. **Multi-facility Support**: Will this system need to support multiple manufacturing facilities in the future?

7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Are there any industry-specific compliance requirements (ISO, FDA, etc.) that need to be considered?

8. **Integration Readiness**: Although not required initially, should the system be designed with API endpoints for future integration needs?

9. **Notification Preferences**: How should urgent notifications be delivered (email, SMS, in-app only)?

10. **Language Support**: Will non-English support be needed in the future, and should the system be designed with internationalization in mind?
