## üîß Environment Variables

The make commands use these default ports:
- Backend API: 3000
- Admin Portal: 3001
- User Portal: 3002

## üí° Tips

1. **Use `make help`** to see a quick reference of available commands
2. **Check service status** with `make ps` before starting development
3. **View logs** with `make logs-[service]` when debugging
4. **Run tests** with `make test-all` before committing
5. **Format code** with `make format-all` to maintain consistency
6. **Use watch mode** for TDD: `make backend-test-watch` or `make frontend-test-watch`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Services won't start
```bash
make down
make clean-volumes
make up
```

### Database connection issues
```bash
make logs-db
make shell-db  # Check if DB is accessible
make db-reset  # Reset if corrupted
```

### Port already in use
```bash
make ps  # Check what's running
make down  # Stop all services
# Or change ports in .env file
```

### Authentication issues
```bash
make keycloak-init  # Reinitialize Keycloak
make fga-init      # Reinitialize OpenFGA
```
